touch is for creating a new file

actual git
git is local
github is the "cloud"
git-DVCS(Distributed Version control software)
repository-directory being tracked using git
start off with git init
to add a file(which already exists) to git repo use:
            git add 'filename' //without quotes
commit is the individual building block of the rep:
            git commit -m "message"
git config --global user.name "name" sets the name
git status tells the status of the rep wrt untracked files and commits
every time you change a file name u have to add and commit, but you can
avoid adding explicitly by using git commit -a flag
every commit is characterized by a commit hash
  commit d39ebb215f477b44846a6c2d47076b97d7560cad //commit hash

  deja vu //commit message
git log is used to look at the commits you have done
Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the
Internet or network somewhere.
git remote add <name> <url>
You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for
the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote
git push pushes the files from branch(generally local) onto the remote
(generally cloud)
git push <remote-name> <branch-name> eg:git push origin master
git show by default shows the latest commit, git show <hash> shows the commit
with that particular hash
